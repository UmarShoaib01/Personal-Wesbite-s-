        <dt>Quality Assurance Intern At TD Bank <img src="Images/TD.png" class = "companyLogos" alt="TD Logo"></dt> 
          <br />
          <dd>
            I collaborated closely with the Card Management POD team to enhance TD
            Bank's Credit Card Application, specifically CCMN and BCH. This
            collaboration led to significant improvements in user experiences and
            the optimization of essential functionalities. I played a pivotal role
            in our Agile practices, conducting thorough manual testing for both
            applications, including black box testing. My responsibilities included
            the successful execution of regression testing during the deployment of
            new features and updates, which ensured consistent performance and
            stability. My expertise in end-to-end testing proved instrumental in
            streamlining our processes and facilitating prompt sign-offs,
            effectively reducing potential bottlenecks. Additionally, I contributed
            by generating innovative test case designs tailored to emerging testing
            requirements. These designs were seamlessly integrated into JIRA,
            maintaining consistency and providing comprehensive test coverage and
            documentation for our projects.

            requirements. Additionally, I actively collaborated with
            cross-functional teams in an Agile environment, participated in daily
            stand-ups and backlog refinement sessions, and managed test cases using
            JIRA/JTMF. My role also encompassed manual testing on credit card

            Employee Movement. Additionally, I took ownership of a third-party Power
            App, building upon existing code and database resources, resulting in
            significant cost savings for the department.

            functionalities to ensure seamless usability. Additionally, I took an
            active role in refining the application's user interface to align with
