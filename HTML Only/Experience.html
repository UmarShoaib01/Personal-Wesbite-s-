        <dd>
          I collaborated closely with the Card Management POD team to enhance TD
          Bank's Credit Card Application, specifically CCMN and BCH. This
          collaboration led to significant improvements in user experiences and
          the optimization of essential functionalities. I played a pivotal role
          in our Agile practices, conducting thorough manual testing for both
          applications, including black box testing. My responsibilities included
          the successful execution of regression testing during the deployment of
          new features and updates, which ensured consistent performance and
          stability. My expertise in end-to-end testing proved instrumental in
          streamlining our processes and facilitating prompt sign-offs,
          effectively reducing potential bottlenecks. Additionally, I contributed
          by generating innovative test case designs tailored to emerging testing
          requirements. These designs were seamlessly integrated into JIRA,
          maintaining consistency and providing comprehensive test coverage and
          documentation for our projects.
