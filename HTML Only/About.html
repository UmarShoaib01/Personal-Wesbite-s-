    <center><h1>About Me</h1></center>
    <p>
      I possess an unwavering passion and deep enthusiasm for software
      development and the ever-evolving world of technology. Currently on track
      to graduate as a computer science co-op student at Wilfrid Laurier
      University in Fall 2023, I'm eager to uncover the exciting possibilities
      ahead. My coding expertise is rooted in Python and Java, complemented by
      skills in VBA, Microsoft Power FX, and a familiarity with HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript. I have experience with the Power Platform from PepsiCo, and I
      have delved into Mobile Development using Java for Android apps and even
      ventured into the realm of cross-platform programming with Flutter (Dart)
      for both iOS and Android devices. Moreover, my time at TD Bank has honed
      my proficiency in automation and manual testing, adding a versatile layer
      to my skill set.
