      <p class="aboutMeP">
        I possess an unwavering passion and deep enthusiasm for software
        development and the ever-evolving world of technology. Currently on track
        to graduate as a computer science co-op student at Wilfrid Laurier
        University in <span class="boldedWords">Fall 2023</span>, I'm eager to
        uncover the exciting possibilities ahead. My coding expertise is rooted in
        <span class="boldedWords">Python and Java</span>, complemented by skills
        in <span class="boldedWords">VBA, Microsoft Power FX</span>, and a
        familiarity with
        <span class="boldedWords">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span>. I have
        experience with the <span class="boldedWords">Power Platform</span> from
        PepsiCo, and I have delved into Mobile Development using
        <span class="boldedWords">Java for Android apps</span> and even ventured
        into the realm of cross-platform programming with
        <span class="boldedWords">Flutter (Dart) for both iOS and Android devices</span>
        Moreover, my time at TD Bank has honed my proficiency in
        <span class="boldedWords">automation and manual testing</span>, adding a versatile layer to my skill set.
